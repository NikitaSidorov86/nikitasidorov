The coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic that has killed at least 27 people in New Jersey this month is taking its toll on hospitals - some of which are running dangerously low on vital equipment such as ventilators.

A doctor at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, a town which has the most coronavirus cases in the state with 118, says the hospital is down to its last three ventilators. Some doctors and nurses there have already gotten sick and others are likely to follow if the hospital can’t add to its dwindling supply of protective equipment.

Another Bergen County hospital — The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood — also is pleading for donations of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as unused N95 respirators, surgical masks, face shields, goggles, isolation gowns and latex-free gloves.

Bergen has 609 coronavirus cases and nine deaths — by far the most of any county in New Jersey. There are at least 2,844 people who have tested positive statewide.

Meanwhile, the federal government is sending over a new shipment of respirators, masks, gloves and other protective equipment requested by New Jersey to cope with the coronavirus, though it still falls short of what the state needs, according to Gov. Phil Murphy’s office.</h2>
